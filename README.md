Work in progress, still planning on developing further. Just need more time to figure out javascript commands to add button id to a list and output/track in a database. Have idea of what I want to do, just having difficulty finding the correct code to do so. New to javascript.
Currently, the web page displays a table of different cocktails that the user can click on an "Add" button for. The idea is that each different button id corresponds to a cocktail drink name which is to be determined once the code runs properly. 
Didnt focus on CSS in this file so I know that it isn't formated to look presentable yet.
